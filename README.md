# PracMachLearn_PeerGradedAssign

# Instructions:

This repository contains the file PGAV1.Rmd that contains the R markdown file describing the analysis made. 

Also included is the file PGAV1.html, which was generated using the “knit to HTML” and a PDF version of the output of PGAV1.Rmd, since I was not able to figure out how to set up the gh-pages (see below).



It also contains the training data file pml-training.csv.

The markdown file can be run by downloading it in R-studio and clicking not he knit symbol (as explained in the file). You must have the data pml-training.csv in the same directory.

You can just read the file as it appears on GitHub, without downloading it. The information in it is practically the same except for some printouts showing examples.

There are no figures in this description.

# Note about gh-pages
I was not able to figure out how to set up the gh-pages. But since this is not a requirement of the assignment, but a suggestion to make it easier to the graders, I would like to apologize for this.

I included a PDF of the analysis, produced with R-studio using the “Knit PDF” option.
I hope this is helpful to get a better understanding of my analysis.
